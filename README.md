# coverage check

Coverage check is designed to evaluate both uniform and variable 
t-way combination coverages of a given test suite. A cumulative 
sum chart is also provided to show the cumulative coverage after 
executing the first k-th test cases. 

The input of this tool is described as in `example.txt`, which
indicates the testing model, the coverage strength to be evaluated,
and the test suite itself.
